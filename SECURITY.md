## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please do not create an issue on GitHub publicly or announce it anywhere publicly right away. Instead, send an e-mail to Freek directly (freekbladnl@gmail.com).

If he does not respond within 2 weeks, you can create an issue publicly on GitHub and mention it elsewhere.
